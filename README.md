# 🛡️ VIGIL AI - Autonomous Personal Security System

A revolutionary Agentic AI System for the Cognivia Hackathon that operates as an autonomous personal security detail for women's safety.

## Overview

VIGIL AI solves the critical problem of manual activation in traditional safety apps by providing **continuous, autonomous monitoring** that requires **no manual intervention**. The system operates 24/7, building a comprehensive "Pattern of Life" model and detecting subtle anomalies that could indicate danger.

## Key Features

### 🤖 Autonomous Operation
- **No Manual Activation Required** - System is always active and monitoring
- Continuous background operation for seamless protection
- Automatic threat detection and alert generation

### 📊 Pattern of Life Model
VIGIL continuously learns and adapts to your normal patterns:
- **GPS Location Tracking** - Monitors location patterns and safe zones
- **Ambient Noise Analysis** - Detects unusual environmental sounds
- **Temporal Pattern Recognition** - Understands time-of-day activity patterns

### 🧠 AI Reasoning Engine
Advanced anomaly detection capabilities:
- Real-time data stream analysis
- Subtle deviation detection
- Multi-factor correlation analysis
- Adaptive threat assessment

### ⚠️ Smart Alert System
- Context-aware notifications
- Severity-based alert classification
- Historical anomaly tracking
- Real-time status updates

### 📈 Safety Baseline
- Establishes personal safety benchmarks
- Compares current status vs. normal patterns
- Visual representation of anomaly detection
- Continuous model improvement

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Design**: Modern glassmorphism UI with gradient effects
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data stream simulation
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser to see the VIGIL AI dashboard in action.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YashG2009/vigil_ui.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd vigil_ui

# Open in browser
open index.html
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: VIGIL ingests real-time data streams from multiple sources:
   - GPS location coordinates
   - Ambient noise levels (decibels)
   - Time of day context

2. **Pattern Learning**: The AI builds a "Pattern of Life" model by:
   - Collecting thousands of data points
   - Establishing baseline patterns
   - Continuously improving model accuracy

3. **Anomaly Detection**: The AI Reasoning Engine:
   - Analyzes deviations from baseline patterns
   - Correlates multiple data streams
   - Detects subtle anomalies that rule-based systems miss

4. **Autonomous Response**: When anomalies are detected:
   - Generates context-aware alerts
   - Adjusts monitoring sensitivity
   - Updates safety baseline in real-time

## Why VIGIL AI?

Traditional safety apps require **manual activation**, which means:
- ❌ Users must remember to activate protection
- ❌ Danger situations may occur before activation
- ❌ Stress/panic can prevent proper app usage

VIGIL AI eliminates these problems with:
- ✅ Always-on autonomous monitoring
- ✅ Proactive threat detection
- ✅ No user action required for protection
- ✅ AI-powered pattern recognition

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real GPS hardware
- Machine learning model training on actual user data
- Emergency contact auto-notification
- Integration with local emergency services
- Wearable device support
- Community safety network
